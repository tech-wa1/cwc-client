            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Competitive Wellness Assessment service provided by Working As 1. We are committed to
                protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled securely and responsibly.
                This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take
                to protect your information.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                We collect your email address when you interact with the Competitive Wellness Assessment service.
                This is the only personal information we collect. We do not collect any other personal identifiers
                or demographic information that could link your responses to your identity.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
            <p>
                The primary purpose of collecting your email address is to facilitate communication regarding the
                Competitive Wellness Assessment, including sending you notifications, reminders, and results of
                the survey. Your email will not be used for any promotional or marketing purposes, ensuring that
                your focus remains on the assessment itself.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Anonymity and Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
                We prioritize your privacy. All survey responses are designed to be anonymous, meaning that no
                personally identifiable information will be associated with your responses. We implement strict
                protocols to ensure that individual responses cannot be traced back to you. Only aggregated data,
                which cannot identify individual respondents, will be shared with your employer or any third parties.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing Practices</h2>
            <p>
                We may share anonymized and aggregated survey results with the companies that participate in the
                Competitive Wellness Assessment. This information helps organizations understand employee wellness
                trends and improve their programs. However, no personal information, including your email address
                or individual survey responses, will be shared with third parties, except where required by law or
                to comply with legal requests.
            </p>

            <h2>5. User Consent</h2>
            <p>
                By providing your email address and participating in the survey, you consent to the collection and
                use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy. You have the right to withdraw your consent at
                any time by contacting us, but please note that this may affect your ability to receive communications
                regarding the assessment.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Compliance with Laws</h2>
            <p>
                We are committed to ensuring that our practices comply with applicable data protection laws, including
                the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union, the California
                Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for California residents, and the Personal Information Protection and
                Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada. We regularly review our policies and practices to ensure
                compliance with these regulations.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Data Protection and Security</h2>
            <p>
                We take the security of your email address seriously. Your information is stored securely using
                industry-standard encryption methods and access controls. Access to your email address is restricted
                to authorized personnel only, who are trained in data protection best practices. We implement measures
                such as firewalls and secure servers to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure
                of your data.
            </p>

            <h2>8. User Rights Regarding Their Data</h2>
            <p>
                You have several rights regarding your data, including:

            <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We will retain your email address only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                policy or as required by law. This retention period will be determined based on our operational needs
                and legal obligations. Once the retention period expires, we will securely delete your email address
                and any associated data.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that
                we have collected personal information from a child under this age, we will take steps to delete that
                information as soon as possible. If you believe that we have collected data from a child, please
                contact us immediately.
            </p>

                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal
                requirements, or for other operational reasons. If we make significant changes to this policy, we will
                notify you by posting the updated policy on our website with a new effective date. We encourage you
